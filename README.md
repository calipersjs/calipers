Current file types supported: **PDF, PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, WEBP**

Calipers was built to provide a method of determining the dimensions of an image or PDF much faster and less resource-intensive than shelling-out to ImageMagick. At [Lob](https://lob.com) we must validate image and PDF sizes during the lifecyle of an API request. The simplest way to do this is to shell-out to ImageMagick to identify the type and size of a file. For high-traffic servers, this becomes a major bottleneck due to the innefficiency of shelling-out.

Calipers remains performant because it avoids spawning child processes and it doesn't read entire files into memory. Instead, it intelligently reads only parts of the files that are necessary to determine the type and the dimensions of the file.

# Installation

The [Poppler](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/) library C++ interface is required for PDF support.

To install Poppler on Mac OS X using Homebrew:

```
brew install poppler
```

To install Poppler on Ubuntu:

```
apt-get install pkg-config
apt-get install libpoppler-cpp-dev
```

To install Calipers, use NPM:

```
npm install calipers
```

# Usage

### `measure(filePath, [callback])`

Measures the PDF, PNG, GIF, or JPEG file at the given path.
- `filePath` - The path of the file.
- `callback` - called when the file has been measured
  - `err` - An Error is thrown for unsupported file types or corrupt files.
  - `result` - Contains keys `type` and `pages`, where `type` is one of `'png'`, `'pdf'`, `'gif'`, `'jpeg'`, `'svg'`, or `'webp'`, and `pages` is an array of objects with keys `width` and `height`. For PNG and JPEG files, `pages` always has 1 element and `width` and `height` are the integer pixel dimensions. For PDF `width` and `height` are floating-point PostScript Point dimensions.

# Examples

```js
var calipers = require('calipers');

// You can use a callback:
calipers.measure('/path/to/document.pdf', function (err, result) {
  // result:
  // {
  //   type: 'pdf',
  //   pages: [
  //     {
  //       width: 450,
  //       height: 670
  //     },
  //     {
  //       width: 450,
  //       height: 670
  //     }
  //   ]
  // }
});

// Or you can use promises:
calipers.measure('/path/to/file.png')
.then(function (result) {
  // result:
  // {
  //   type: 'png',
  //   pages: [
  //     {
  //       width: 450,
  //       height: 670
  //     }
  //   ]
  // }
});
```

# Benchmarks

As with all benchmarks, take these with a grain of salt. You can run the benchmarks on your own hardware: `node benchmark/index.js`.

These benchmarks are running 500 iterations of each method  on the 123x456 PDF, PNG, and JPEG with a concurrency setting of 50. They were run on a Mid-2014 13" MacBook Pro with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5.

Method | FileType | Time (ms)
------ | -------- | ----:
exec: pdfinfo  | PDF | 1897
exec: identify | PNG | 1801
exec: identify | JPEG | 1820
calipers | PDF | 104
calipers | PNG | 41
calipers | JPEG | 80

# Contribute

The easiest and most helpful way to contribute is to find a file that calipers incorrectly measures, and submit a PR with the file. The tests automatically run against all files in the `test/fixtures` directory, so simply drop it into the appropriate subdirectory, and name it according to its size `<width>x<height>.png`. If it's a PDF, include the page count and round the PostScript Point to the nearest integer: `<width>x<height>.<page count>.pdf`. Fixes for these files are welcome, but not necessary.
